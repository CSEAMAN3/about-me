# about-me

Create an About Me guessing game that utilizes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

Include on your HTML page a short biography, your education history, an overview of your job experience, and any goals that you may have.

Prompt the user a total of exactly five yes or no questions. The user input for the answer must accept either y/n or yes/no responses while taking into consideration case sensitivity by normalizing the user input so that it can be validated (hint: look into the .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() functions). Be sure to let the user know if they answered the question correctly by alerting them with a response.

Add console.log() messages within your app to notify the user if they are correct. Before submitting, comment out (donâ€™t delete) your console.log() messages and replace them with the alerts() to complete the project.

Notes Friday

// comparison operators
a == b // loose equal to
a === b // Strict equal to
a != b // not equal to
a !== b // strict not equal to
a > b // greater than
a < b // less than
a >= b // greater than or equal to
a <= b // less than or equal to

// logical opertors
a && b // is a AND b true
a || b // is a OR b true
!a // not - inverts the boolean value of a (make it the opposite so if something is true it will make it false)

// evaluating comparisons
( <operand><operator><operand>)
( 1 === 2 )

// type coercion
let a = 5
a = "cookie"

"10" > 1
true - this will make the string into a number

"5" == 5
true - this will make the number into a string

//for loop - intitial value, condition, increment
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++>){
console.log(i)
}
